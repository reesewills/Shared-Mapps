Overall your app was very impressive. We did have some minor criticisms:

When you viewed a map for the first time it was very zoomed out, which was a bit inconvenient.
I also noticed that your app crashed once mid demo.

These criticisms are pretty minor overall, you should be proud of this project. Great job!
